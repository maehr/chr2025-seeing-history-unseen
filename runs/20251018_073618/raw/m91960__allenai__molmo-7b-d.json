Text above reads \"Wenn das Wolf in ihn um.\"*\n\n*This image appears to be a historical anti-Semitic cartoon from the Swiss newspaper \"Allgemeine Schweizer Zeitung\" (General Swiss Newspaper) dated February 14, 1898. It depicts the conflict over railway nationalization in Switzerland. The cartoon contrasts two scenarios: if the railway nationalization is rejected, a strong Switzerland (represented by a powerful woman) is forced into a position of need by foreign capitalists (the kneeling woman). If acceptance is proposed, a weaker Switzerland (the kneeling woman) begs for financial support from these capitalists.*\n\n*The cartoon uses anti-Semitic stereotypes to portray foreign capitalists as exploitative Jews who would take advantage of Switzerland's interests. It reflects the divisive political climate surrounding railway modernization in late 19th-century Switzerland, highlighting fears about economic control and national identity.*",
