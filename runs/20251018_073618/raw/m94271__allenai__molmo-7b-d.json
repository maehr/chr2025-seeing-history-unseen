The chain appears to be attached to the rock with twine. The rock has a small red stamp on its side, though the text is not legible. This artifact is likely a piece of shrapnel or debris from a bomb, specifically from the Siege of Basel in 1815. It serves as a tangible reminder of the military conflict that took place in the region during the Napoleonic Wars. The rock's weathered appearance and the attached chain suggest it has been through significant wear and tear over the past two centuries.",
