This imagery reflects the liberal Swiss public's view of the railway in the mid-19th century. It was part of the design plans for the first Basel Central Station (1860-1903), created by Ludwig Maring, the SCB's chief engineer. Maring developed the plans in 1858 based on the board's specifications, with construction beginning in 1859. This artwork, part of the station's interior, depicted the railway as a modern, efficient symbol of progress and good fortune. (Meles 1984, pp. 36-37; Krings 1985, p. 78)*",
