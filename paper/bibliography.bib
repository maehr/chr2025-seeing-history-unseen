	abstract = {The production of a comprehensive history of the city of Basel has been underway at the University of Basel since 2018. More than 70 authors are investigating the past 2200 years and preparing 10 volumes for print. In 2017, the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel Foundation, which is carrying out the project, made a commitment to the canton of Basel-Stadt to make the research data available to the public via an online portal. We interpret this commitment as meaning that the research data will be collected, processed and secured for later use and long-term archiving in a first step, before being made available to the general public in a second step. This raises the question - and this is a general problem in historical research - of what research data are and, following on from this, how they can be made accessible. A field report striving to think about epistemological and methodological consequences.},

  abstract = {This manual is a guide to creating non-discriminatory metadata for historical sources and research data, developed as part of the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel research project. It is aimed at professional historians, archivists, librarians and anyone involved in open research data in the field of history. The authors Moritz M{\"a}hr and No{\"e}lle Schnegg guide readers through the practical aspects of creating metadata based on the FAIR principles to make research data discoverable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. Through practical instructions and illustrated case studies, the manual shows how machine-readable metadata can enrich research and teaching and influence the interpretation of historical sources. As a publicly accessible "living document", it is designed for continuous development by the community and is committed to an inclusive and non-discriminatory representation of historical content. The handbook is a fundamental resource for anyone interested in modern digital history and open research data. It is available in German.},
